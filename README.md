## ðŸ“Š Dataset 1: `summary_and_regression_data.csv`

This dataset was used for:

- **Generating summary statistics** (see Table 1 of the manuscript)
- **Fitting linear regression models** to analyze the effects of fuel treatments, vegetation, ignition, and weather variables on:
  - Area burned (AB)
  - Total cost (TC), including fuel treatment and timber loss due to wildfire

The variables included in this dataset are described in **Table 1** of the manuscript.  
Note: While **air temperature is listed in Celsius (`T_inC`)** in Table 1 for clarity, the **regression models use temperature in Kelvin (`T_inK`)** to improve numerical stability and interpretability.

All continuous response variables were log-transformed (`log_AB` and `log_TC`) to meet model assumptions.

### ðŸ“ˆ Example R Code for Regression Models

#### ðŸ”¹ Area Burned Model (Results in Table 2)

```r
model_ab <- lm(log_AB ~ h + RH + WS + T_inK + PB + TFB + Bdtn + Bdnt + Bm + tau +
                  PB:Bdtn + PB:Bdnt + TFB:Bdtn + TFB:Bdnt +
                  PB:Bm + TFB:Bm + PB:tau + TFB:tau + PB:d + TFB:d,
               data = data_summary_regression)
summary(model_ab)
```

#### ðŸ”¹ Total Cost Model (Results in Table 3)

```r
model_tc <- lm(log_TC ~ h + RH + WS + T_inK + PB + TFB + Bdtn + Bdnt + Bm + tau +
                  PB:Bdtn + PB:Bdnt + TFB:Bdtn + TFB:Bdnt +
                  PB:Bm + TFB:Bm + TFB:tau + PB:d,
               data = data_summary_regression)
summary(model_tc)
```

> **Note**: Regression results for the area burned and total cost models are presented in **Tables 2 and 3** of the manuscript, respectively.
